Used this link https://www.raywenderlich.com/5456-in-app-purchase-tutorial-getting-started  to setup IAP on Appstore Connect.

I amy have to delete and redo as Consumable as multiple emails will be needed.  Look into how to create email aliases etc.

I am awaiting Apple's approval for Tax and Banking changes to update etc. can take 3+ days.


4/27/2021: Trying to redo this process for IAP.  Deleted the app but it can be restored.  Need to consider a New App ID or New certificate
This way I can make as consumable.  Can't seem to be able to edit the first attempt.

4/28/2021:
Finished the IAP tutorial setup in AppConnect etc.  Downloaded new version of GIMP as the APP will need some screen shots for metadata.

Ready to begin the code part of the Tutuorial.  Remember I have a sandbox tester called John Appleseed with email joseph@pc-sg.com This will be needed to make IAP purchases.

ALSO: NOTE I did my configuration for razefacrsjr as Consumable; however, the tutorial will be based on Non Consumable.


5/3/2021: Remember will need to configure - Sign in with Apple for Email Communication - found under the More section of Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.  This will allow users to sign in to my apps with their Apple ID needed for updates etc.


I sent Apple Support an email requesting update of Tax and Banking etc and EIN - it generated a support ticket number saved in ikissable folder.

Began Tutorial setting up the APP Take and added Capability for In App.  However, this is different from the tutorial where this feature can be turned on/off.
